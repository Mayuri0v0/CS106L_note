# 5. Containers

## Defining Containers

Container: An object that allows us to&#x20;collect other objects together and interact&#x20;with them in some way.

Think of **vectors**, **stacks**, or **queues**!



### Why Containers?

1. Organization: Related data   &#x20;can be   &#x20;packaged   &#x20;together!
2. Standardization: Common   &#x20;features are   &#x20;expected and   &#x20;implemented
3. Abstraction: Complex ideas   &#x20;made easier to   &#x20;utilize by   &#x20;clients
